## 🧠 About Me

I'm an IT professional with **2+ years of hands-on experience** supporting users, troubleshooting systems, and building small-to-medium networks. I enjoy breaking things down, fixing them, and making systems more secure and reliable. My long-term goal is to transition fully into **cybersecurity**, with a strong foundation in networking, system administration, and cloud fundamentals.

I learn best by **doing** — labs, home networks, certifications, and real-world troubleshooting.
